# NIRC2-Pol Operations Software

Last Updated: 29 April 2026

NIRC2 Polarimetry (NIRC2-Pol, or nirc2p) is a dual-channel polarimetry mode on the Keck II NIRC2 infrared imager. Dual-channel polarimetry uses a polarizing beamsplitter to split the incoming light into two orthogonal polarization states, and a half-wave plate (HWP) to modulate the angle of polarization. Through cycles of four critical HWP angles (0°, 45°, 22.5°, 67.5°), it is possible to recover the linear Stokes vector components Q and U (see de Boer+ 2020 for a description of dual-channel polarimetry and double differencing). 

NIRC2-Pol enables polarimetric observations in JHKL’ bands in combination with multiple existing NIRC2 modes, such as grism spectroscopy and high-contrast coronagraphic imaging, and both NGS and LGS AO. This is useful for many science cases, from solar system objects to circumstellar disks and active galactic nuclei. NIRC2-Pol was developed as part of the Precision Calibration Unit (PCU2) project on Keck II. 

**About this repository**

This repository contains scripts for efficiently operating the NIRC2 Polarimetry mode. The most officially up-to-date versions of operations scripts will soon be transferred to and managed with Keck's internal SVN version control, where observatory staff will maintain them. Other repositories ([NIRC2-DPP](https://github.com/UCSB-Exoplanet-Polarimetry-Lab/NIRC2Pol-DPP), [pyPolCal](https://github.com/UCSB-Exoplanet-Polarimetry-Lab/pyPolCal)) contain code related to data processing for the mode and instrumental polarization calibration.

**Files in this repo**

- [Folder] `Commissioning Analysis` = Various files and scripts from use in commissioning; kept as a "historical record"
- `Fast_Axis_Cal_Sequence.sh` = Takes data 0 to 180 deg in steps of 10 for use in finding the fast axis of a HWP.
- `HWP_Rotation_Sequence.sh` = Used for typical observing sequences (four critical angles: 0, 45, 22.5, 67.5 deg)
- `Internal_Pol_Cal_Sequence.sh` = Takes data rotating both HWP and IMR for instrumental polarization calibration

**Syntax for using each script**

`bash Fast_Axis_Cal_Sequence.sh FILTER=[filter]`

`bash HWP_Rotation_Sequence.sh KWARG=[KEYWORD_VALUE]`

`bash Internal_Pol_Cal_Sequence.sh FILTER=[filter]`

See the Operations Guide below for a full description of these commands and their various options/keywords.

**Operations/Observer's Guide**

A [draft version of the NIRC2-Pol operations/observer's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xZ5t1CYUM9_GUHD_lKeaxhGwf5xAPUc301j2dv2oiKI/edit?tab=t.v9hqfo1pspp7#heading=h.ej8cynj3sfoq) is available.
